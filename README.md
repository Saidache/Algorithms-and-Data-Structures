# Algorithms and Data Structures â€” C Implementations

Welcome to my repository of **Algorithms and Data Structures** written in **C**.  
This project includes my personal implementations of essential data structures and solutions to exercises provided by our professor.

## Contents:

### Exercises & Tests:
A collection of solved problems and exercises assigned by our professor:
- Problem statements
- C code solutions

#### Stack
- Implements **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**
- Basic operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`

#### Queue
- Implements **First In, First Out (FIFO)**
- Basic operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `isEmpty`

#### Linked List
- Dynamic linear data structure
- Basic operations: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, `display`
